The website http://medical.democrat is a derivative work, 
based on the Template named "Landed" by HTML5 UP, described
below ====== line below.

The author holds significant evidence supporting a belief that great
iatrogenic harm is routinely inflicted upon myriad patients of
many different healthcare institutions in many different countries
without the patients realizing that they have been harmed because
these patients have an insufficient understanding of medicine.

The Medical Democrat is a project that is attempting to make
learning resources available to everyone that when thoroughly
understood, can help protect patients from such iatrogenic harm.

A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.
